vi zoo.cfg:
leaderServes=true  #Leader accepts client connections. Default value is "yes".
dataDir=/var/lib/zookeeper
dataLogDir=/var/log/zookeeper
server.1=172.18.91.143:2881:3881 #server.x is the server id which should be same as myid file,The first port followers use to connect to the leader, and the second is for leader election.
server.2=172.18.91.144:2881:3881 #2881这个端口用来集群内部进行数据交换，所有的follower都会连接到leader的这个端口只有leader会监听这个端口,3881是用来选举leader的时候用的。
server.3=172.18.91.145:2881:3881

other useful configuration options:
tickTime: 
the length of a single tick, which is the basic time unit used by ZooKeeper, as measured in milliseconds. It is used to regulate heartbeats, and timeouts. For example, the minimum session timeout will be two ticks.
initLimit:
Amount of time, in ticks (see tickTime), to allow followers to connect and sync to a leader. Increased this value as needed, if the amount of data managed by ZooKeeper is large.
syncLimit:
Amount of time, in ticks (see tickTime), to allow followers to sync with ZooKeeper. If followers fall too far behind a leader, they will be dropped.


echo 1 >/var/lib/zookeeper/myid

set ZOO_LOG_DIR="/var/log/zookeeper/"  in zkEnv.sh  to store the zookeeper.out file

su nobody -s /bin/bash -c "/opt/zookeeper/bin/zkServer.sh start"



Keeper Commands: The Four Letter Words
ZooKeeper responds to a small set of commands. Each command is composed of four letters. You issue the commands to ZooKeeper via telnet or nc, at the client port.

Three of the more interesting commands: "stat" gives some general information about the server and connected clients, while "srvr" and "cons" give extended details on server and connections respectively.

conf
New in 3.3.0: Print details about serving configuration.

cons
New in 3.3.0: List full connection/session details for all clients connected to this server. Includes information on numbers of packets received/sent, session id, operation latencies, last operation performed, etc...

crst
New in 3.3.0: Reset connection/session statistics for all connections.

dump
Lists the outstanding sessions and ephemeral nodes. This only works on the leader.

envi
Print details about serving environment

ruok
Tests if server is running in a non-error state. The server will respond with imok if it is running. Otherwise it will not respond at all.

A response of "imok" does not necessarily indicate that the server has joined the quorum, just that the server process is active and bound to the specified client port. Use "stat" for details on state wrt quorum and client connection information.

srst
Reset server statistics.

srvr
New in 3.3.0: Lists full details for the server.

stat
Lists brief details for the server and connected clients.

wchs
New in 3.3.0: Lists brief information on watches for the server.

wchc
New in 3.3.0: Lists detailed information on watches for the server, by session. This outputs a list of sessions(connections) with associated watches (paths). Note, depending on the number of watches this operation may be expensive (ie impact server performance), use it carefully.

wchp
New in 3.3.0: Lists detailed information on watches for the server, by path. This outputs a list of paths (znodes) with associated sessions. Note, depending on the number of watches this operation may be expensive (ie impact server performance), use it carefully.

Here's an example of the ruok command:

$ echo ruok | nc 127.0.0.1 5111
imok
