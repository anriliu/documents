To create a bridge named br0, that have eth0 and eth1 as members:
ip link add name br0 type bridge
ip link set dev br0 up
ip link set dev eth0 master br0
ip link set dev eth1 master br0

To remove an interface from the bridge:
ip link set dev eth0 nomaster

And finally, to destroy a bridge after no interface is member:
ip link del br0


ip link set br0 type bridge stp_state 1
ip link help bridge

Forwarding manipulation
To manipulate other aspects of the bridge like the FDB(Forwarding Database) I suggest you to take a look at the bridge(8) command. Examples:
Show forwarding database on br0
bridge fdb show dev br0

Disable a port(eth0) from processing BPDUs. This will make the interface filter any incoming bpdu
bridge link set dev eth0 guard on

Setting STP Cost to a port(eth1 for example):
bridge link set dev eth1 cost 4

To set root guard on eth1:
bridge link set dev eth1 root_block on

Cost is calculated using some factors, and the link speed is one of them. Using a fix cost and disabling the processing of BPDUs and enabling root_block is somehow simmilar to a guard-root feature from switches.
Other features like vepa, veb and hairpin mode can be found on bridge link sub-command list.

VLAN rules manipulation
The vlan object from the bridge command will allow you to create ingress/egress filters on bridges.

To show if there is any vlan ingress/egress filters:
bridge vlan show

To add rules to a given interface:
bridge vlan add dev eth1 <vid, pvid, untagged, self, master>

To remove rules. Use the same parameters as vlan add at the end of the command to delete a specific rule.
bridge vlan delete dev eth1




policy route:
iptables -t mangle -A FORWARD -s 192.168.0.0/16  -j MARK --set-mark 1 #there mush have some filter can't just MARK without filter or the ip rule won't work
ip rule fwmark 1 table 999
if also need turn off rp_filter:
sysctl net.ipv4.conf.default.rp_filter=0

Tables
iptables contains five tables:

raw is used only for configuring packets so that they are exempt from connection tracking.
filter is the default table, and is where all the actions typically associated with a firewall take place.
nat is used for network address translation (e.g. port forwarding).
mangle is used for specialized packet alterations.
security is used for Mandatory Access Control networking rules (e.g. SELinux -- see this article for more details)
