git status
git stash  #Use git stash when you want to record the current state of the working directory and the index, but want to go back to a clean working directory.
       The command saves your local modifications away and reverts the working directory to match the HEAD commit.
The modifications stashed away by this command can be listed with git stash list, inspected with git stash show, and restored (potentially on top
       of a different commit) with git stash apply. 

customhooks中会设置 $GIT_DIR变量，如果要再非当前repo执行命令，需要unset $GIT_DIR
