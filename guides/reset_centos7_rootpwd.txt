1.Start the system and, on the GRUB 2 boot screen, press the e key for edit.

2.Remove the rhgb and quiet parameters from the end, or near the end, of the linux16 line, or linuxefi on UEFI systems.

3.Add ‘rd.break enforcing=0’ at the end of the linux line on 64-Bit IBM Power Series, the linux16 line on x86-64 BIOS-based systems, or the linuxefi line on UEFI systems

4.Press Ctrl+x to boot the system with the changed parameters.

5.Remount the file system as writable:
switch_root:/# mount -o remount,rw /sysroot

6.Change the file system's root as follows:
switch_root:/# chroot /sysroot

7.Enter the passwd command and follow the instructions displayed on the command line to change the root password.

8.Updating the password file results in a file with the incorrect SELinux security context. 
sh-4.2# touch /.autorelabel

9.Remount the file system as read only:
sh-4.2# mount -o remount,ro /

10.Enter the exit command to exit the chroot environment and wait system boot


11.If you added the enforcing=0 option in step 3 and omitted the touch /.autorelabel command in step 8, enter the following command to restore the /etc/shadow file's SELinux security context:
~]# restorecon /etc/shadow
