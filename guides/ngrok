Introspected tunnels to localhost

ngrok is a reverse proxy that creates a secure tunnel from a public endpoint to a locally running web service. ngrok captures and analyzes all traffic over the tunnel for later inspection and replay.  
What can I do with ngrok?

Expose any http service behind a NAT or firewall to the internet on a subdomain of ngrok.com  
Expose any tcp service behind a NAT or firewall to the internet on a random port of ngrok.com  
Inspect all http requests/responses that are transmitted over the tunnel  
Replay any request that was transmitted over the tunnel
