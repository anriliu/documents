set -e stops the execution of a script if a command or pipeline has an error - which is the opposite of the default shell behaviour, which is to ignore errors in scripts.
It only stops execution if the last command in a pipeline has an error. There's a Bash specific option, set -o pipefail 
like set -e -o pipefail ;true | false | true;echo $?


exit once script try to access unset variables
set -u      Treat unset variables and parameters other than the special parameters "@" and "*" as an error when performing parameter expansion.  If expansion  is  attempted on an unset variable or parameter, the shell prints an error message, and, if not interactive, exits with a non-zero status.

set  --   If no arguments follow this option, then the positional parameters are unset.  Otherwise, the positional parameters are set to the args, even if  some  of  them  begin with a -.
set  -   Signal  the  end of options, cause all remaining args to be assigned to the positional parameters.  The -x and -v options are turned off.  If there are no args the positional parameters remain unchanged.


Bash Extended Globbing:
bash中除了*，?和[]路径扩展之外还有下面这些额外的扩展在shopt -s extglob开始时生效:
  ?(pattern-list)   Matches zero or one occurrence of the given patterns
  *(pattern-list)   Matches zero or more occurrences of the given patterns
  +(pattern-list)   Matches one or more occurrences of the given patterns
  @(pattern-list)   Matches one of the given patterns
  !(pattern-list)   Matches anything except one of the given patterns

pipeline：
 command [ [|⎪|&] command2 ... ]
The standard output of command is connected via a pipe to the standard input of command2.  This connection is  performed  before  any  redirections
specified  by  the command (see REDIRECTION below) If |& is used, the standard error of command is connected to command2's standard input through the pipe; it is shorthand for 2>&1 |


command [-pVv] command [arg ...]
Run  command  with  args suppressing the normal shell function lookup. Only builtin commands or commands found in the PATH are executed. 
也可以用来在默认PATH路径下查找命令，失败返回127
